## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##1 Consider a 2x2 design. Assume the DV is measured from a normal distribution with mean 0, and standard deviation 1. Assume that the main effect of A causes a total shift of .5 standard deviations of the mean between the levels. Assume that level 1 of B is a control, where you expect to measure the standard effect of A. Assume that level 2 of B is an experimental factor intended to reduce the effect of A by .25 standard deviations.

A. create a ggplot2 figure that depicts the expected results from this design (2 points) 

Conduct simulation-based power analyses to answer the questions.

B. How many subjects are needed to detect the main effect of A with power = .8? (2 points)

C. How many subjects are needed to detect the interaction effect with power = .8? (2 points)

```{r}
# define 2-factor score model
grand_mean <- 0
A <- c(-0,.5)
B <- c(0, 0)
AB <- rep(0,0,0,-.25)

# create design table
library(tibble)
model_data <- tibble()
for(i in 1:length(A)){
  for(j in 1:length(B)){
    IVA <- i
    IVB <- j
    DV <- grand_mean+A[i]+B[j]+AB[(i-1)*length(B)+j]
    sc_GM <- grand_mean
    sc_A <- A[i]
    sc_B <- B[j]
    sc_AB <- AB[(i-1)*length(B)+j]
    row_entry <- tibble(IVA,IVB,DV,
                        sc_GM,sc_A,sc_B,sc_AB)
    model_data <- rbind(model_data,row_entry)
  }
}

knitr::kable(model_data)
```
