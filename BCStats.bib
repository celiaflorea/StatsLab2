	abstract = {In the {RI} paradigm, 5s learned passages of connected discourse by the anticipation method. Three levels of {OL} practice (2, 4, and 8 trials) and three levels of {IL} practice (0, 4, and 8 trials) were given, with appropriate counterbalancing in a mixed design. Results indicated that (a) {OL} and {IL} acquisition was a function of number of practice trials, (b) recall of prose was subject to significant {RI}, (c) recall varied directly with {OL} practice and inversely with {IL} practice, and (d) recall errors suggested a shift in the covert-overt error ratio paralleling recall, and an increase in interlist intrusions at points of near equal acquisition of the two passages. It is concluded that findings regarding degree of learning and {RI}, based on unconnected materials, can now be generalized to connected discourse.},

	abstract = {A consensus on the importance of open data and reproducible code is emerging. How should data and code be shared to maximize the key desiderata of reproducibility, permanence, and accessibility? Research assets should be stored persistently in formats that are not software restrictive, and documented so that others can reproduce and extend the required computations. The sharing method should be easy to adopt by already busy researchers. We suggest the R package standard as a solution for creating, curating, and communicating research assets. The R package standard, with extensions discussed herein, provides a format for assets and metadata that satisfies the above desiderata, facilitates reproducibility, open access, and sharing of materials through online platforms like {GitHub} and Open Science Framework. We discuss a stack of R resources that help users create reproducible collections of research assets, from experiments to manuscripts, in the {RStudio} interface. We created an R package, vertical, to help researchers incorporate these tools into their workflows, and discuss its functionality at length in an online supplement. Together, these tools may increase the reproducibility and openness of psychological science.},

The present study shows, however, that the computation for randomization test counterparts of the t test and one-way analysis of variance can be relatively inexpensive when performed by a high-speed computer.},

	abstract = {When analyzing the results of an experiment, the mental focus on a specific hypothesis might prevent the exploration of other aspects of the data, effectively blinding one to new ideas. To test this notion, we performed an experiment in which we asked undergraduate students to analyze a fictitious dataset. In addition to being asked what they could conclude from the dataset, half of the students were asked to also test specific hypotheses. In line with our notion, students in the hypothesis-free group were almost 5 times more likely to observe an image of a gorilla when simply plotting the data, a proxy for an initial step towards data analysis. If these findings are representative also of scientific research as a whole, they warrant concern about the current emphasis on hypothesis-driven research, especially in the context of information-rich datasets such as those now routinely created in the biological sciences. Our work provides evidence for a link between the psychological effect of selective attention and hypothesis-driven data analysis, and suggests a hidden cost to having a hypothesis when analyzing a dataset.},

	abstract = {The question of how people’s preferences are shaped by their choices has generated decades of research. In a classic example, work on cognitive dissonance has found that observers who must choose between two equally attractive options subsequently avoid the unchosen option, suggesting that not choosing the item led them to like it less. However, almost all of the research on such choice-induced preference focuses on adults, leaving open the question of how much experience is necessary for its emergence. Here, we examined the developmental roots of this phenomenon in preverbal infants (N = 189). In a series of seven experiments using a free-choice paradigm, we found that infants experienced choice-induced preference change similar to adults’. Infants’ choice patterns reflected genuine preference change and not attraction to novelty or inherent attitudes toward the options. Hence, choice shapes preferences—even without extensive experience making decisions and without a well-developed self-concept.},
